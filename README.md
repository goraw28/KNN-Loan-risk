## ðŸš€Hi, I'm Gaurav
I'm an aspiring Data Scientist


Here's a gist of some of my project

#Python ML Classification Project


In this particular project, we are using a dataset that contains information like, Age, Total Work Experience, number of years in city, cost to request ratio etc and using that to classify loan applicantâ€™s Risk segmentation.



## Methodology to gain the best accuracy in predictions

Part-1) 

load the given dataset

Check for the null values

Get basic information from data

Describe the dataset

Display scatterplot between age & Total work Experience

Display box plot for age

Display box plot for Cibil score

Create target and features data 

PART-2)

Split data into training and testing sets

Create KNN classifier between Features and target data

Display the test score

Display the training score

Print the accuracy score

Try different k values for classifier

Display training and testing score for all the different k values


## Tools used

Scatter plot
Box plot
KNN Classifier
